*For each bot to be deployed, run 'python createdb.py DATABASENAME' where DATABASENAME is the name of the database to be created
*look at dummydata.sql and the docs to see how your data should be formatted. There are also database diagrams created using Dia - an open source diagram editor.
*to start the bot, run 'python main.py DATABASENAME' and the bot will join the channel
